# Beemo Join Difference Calculator - Unofficial

This small app allows you to see the time between joins of account in a [Beemo](https://beemo.gg) raid log. An example output when using the CLI would be
```
Analyzed 14827 joins. Average difference between join times is 66ms. 

573 joins out of 14826 happened at the same time (0.039% of all)
```

While in general this tool offers no real practical use, it was fun to build and can provide interesting statistics.
